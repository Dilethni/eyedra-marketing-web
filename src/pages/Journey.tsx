As a group of passionate software development students, we came together, each bringing unique skills, to build something meaningful. After numerous brainstorming sessions, we decided to create Eyedra‚Äîa mental health social networking platform designed to provide a safe, anonymous, and interactive space for users. With features like private support groups, augmented reality-based Campfire Sessions, and an AI mascot assistant, Eyedra aims to revolutionize the way people connect, share, and support each other on their mental well-being journey.",

We asked ourselves tough questions: How can we create a safe and engaging space for mental well-being? Who will benefit the most from our platform? After countless discussions, wireframes, and brainstorming sessions, we finally had a clear vision‚ÄîEyedra. A platform designed to provide anonymous peer support and immersive Campfire Sessions using augmented reality. This became the foundation of our project, driven by the goal of making mental health support more accessible and interactive.",

Debugging felt endless, and testing was exhausting, but we remained determined. Each small victory‚Äîwhether it was refining the AI mascot assistant, optimizing the Campfire Sessions, or enhancing privacy controls‚Äîbrought us closer to our goal. Every bug fixed, every feature implemented, felt like a milestone in our journey toward creating a truly impactful mental health platform.",
